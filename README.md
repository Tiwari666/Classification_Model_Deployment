=======================================================
# Project Overview
This project involves deploying a machine learning model that classifies text based on sentiment. The Flask app serves as the interface for model interaction, allowing users to submit text and receive classification results in real time.

# Repository Structure:

--data/: Contains datasets used for training and testing the model.

--models/: Stores the trained model files for prediction.

--scripts/:

--app.py: The Flask application file that runs the web server.

--test_flask_api.py: Script to test the Flask API.

--Other scripts related to data processing and model evaluation.

-- venv/: Virtual environment with dependencies required for the project.

--requirements.txt: Lists all Python libraries needed to run the project.

# How to Use
To use the application, start the Flask server by running app.py and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser. Use the /predict endpoint to submit text and receive sentiment analysis results.

# Future Improvements:

--Enhance model accuracy by incorporating more complex algorithms or deeper neural networks.

--Improve user interface for easier interaction.

--Implement additional features like bulk processing of text data.

# Getting Started

To set up this project locally:

--Clone this repository.

--Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.

--Run python scripts/app.py to start the Flask server.

--For more detailed instructions on how to interact with the API, refer to the test_flask_api.py script.
