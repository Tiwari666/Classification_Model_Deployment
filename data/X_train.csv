Review
The worst was the salmon sashimi.
An excellent new restaurant by an experienced Frenchman.
Went for lunch - service was slow.
I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.
Just had lunch here and had a great experience.
I got home to see the driest damn wings ever!
DELICIOUS!!
They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!
And then tragedy struck.
Awful service.
"Great food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount."
The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.
"I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch."
For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.
The fried rice was dry as well.
"Both of them were truly unbelievably good, and I am so glad we went back."
Eclectic selection.
Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.
The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Service is quick and even ""to go"" orders are just like we like it!"
This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!
They also now serve Indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world.
What happened next was pretty....off putting.
"My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing."
The pizza selections are good.
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.
"No, I'm going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it."
We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.
-My order was not correct.
If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.
The selection was probably the worst I've seen in Vegas.....there was none.
I can't tell you how disappointed I was.
"This place is a jewel in Las Vegas, and exactly what I've been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here."
"The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way."
"seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
This was like the final blow!
"If the food isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people."
After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!
"When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing."
Everything was gross.
Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.
Service is friendly and inviting.
Everything was perfect the night we were in.
Once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place.
"Will never, ever go back."
Sooooo good!!
I never come again.
The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.
Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.
The turkey and roast beef were bland.
Spend your money and time some place else.
"Great atmosphere, friendly and fast service."
If you stay in Vegas you must get breakfast here at least once.
Service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see.
"A couple of months later, I returned and had an amazing meal."
"Point your finger at any item on the menu, order it and you won't be disappointed."
"There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better"
"Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree."
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.
Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting.
The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.
Food arrived quickly!
"The service was not up to par, either."
As always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious!
"The service was great, even the manager came and helped with our table."
Mediocre food.
I won't be back.
The roast beef sandwich tasted really good!
They have great dinners.
I will be back many times soon.
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.
Spend your money elsewhere.
Owner's are really great people.!
first time there and might just be the last.
A great touch.
The live music on Fridays totally blows.
"Good value, great food, great service."
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.
Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.
I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.
This place is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Everyone is very attentive, providing excellent customer service."
Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!
"For about 10 minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon."
Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.
(The bathroom is just next door and very nice.)
My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor.
The folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special.
It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.
"It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor."
"The chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh."
"I'd rather eat airline food, seriously."
The inside is really quite nice and very clean.
Pretty cool I would say.
"Love the margaritas, too!"
This place lacked style!!
"Strike 2, who wants to be rushed."
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.
We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).
I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.
Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.
"Furthermore, you can't even find hours of operation on the website!"
My girlfriend's veal was very bad.
"Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best."
I love this place.
I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.
The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.
Food was delicious!
It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.
Everything was good and tasty!
Over rated.
Would not recommend to others.
"The food is delicious and just spicy enough, so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way."
I was so insulted.
"As for the ""mains,"" also uninspired."
Everyone is treated equally special.
The Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.
My friend loved the salmon tartar.
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.
I give it 2 thumbs down
The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.
I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.
So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.
Overall I wasn't very impressed with Noca.
The vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic Thai.
"This isn't a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment."
Not my thing.
The management is rude.
Our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff.
She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.
"The food was great as always, compliments to the chef."
"The staff is always super friendly and helpful, which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby!"
Wow... Loved this place.
"By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known."
The atmosphere here is fun.
"not even a ""hello, we will be right with you."""
"All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting."
"The best place in Vegas for breakfast (just check out a Sat, or Sun."
The steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked.
Today was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible.
The waitresses are very friendly.
"Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!"
Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.
From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.
I would recommend saving room for this!
"And the drinks are WEAK, people!"
"In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience."
"The building itself seems pretty neat, the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again."
I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.
The chefs were friendly and did a good job.
I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.
A great way to finish a great.
Just don't know why they were so slow.
Penne vodka excellent!
Good beer & drink selection and good food selection.
What a mistake that was!
You won't be disappointed.
Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.
We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.
Boy was that sucker dry!!.
"Great Subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations."
I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.
Restaurant is always full but never a wait.
"Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed."
"What did bother me, was the slow service."
"I had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied."
This is a disgrace.
So flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat.
Bacon is hella salty.
I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.
Don't do it!!!!
"Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!"
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.)
There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.
We had a group of 70+ when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully.
"It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk."
I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
It was packed!!
If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.
The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.
Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.
Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV's.
"The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!"
The RI style calamari was a joke.
"I also had to taste my Mom's multi-grain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing, fluffy, and delicious!"
"They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers."
The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.
The flair bartenders are absolutely amazing!
I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.
There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.
"We had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed."
Will go back next trip out.
"My breakfast was perpared great, with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of Toast, lightly dusted with powdered sugar."
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.
Left very frustrated.
"Anyway, this FS restaurant has a wonderful breakfast/lunch."
This is a GREAT place to eat!
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.
So they performed.
"This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things."
The steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at GC.
This place is two thumbs up....way up.
They really want to make your experience a good one.
"Hawaiian Breeze, Mango Magic, and Pineapple Delight are the smoothies that I've tried so far and they're all good."
"It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it."
"OMG, the food was delicioso!"
He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.
My gyro was basically lettuce only.
it was a drive to get there.
"Needless to say, I won't be going back anytime soon."
Join the club and get awesome offers via email.
The seafood was fresh and generous in portion.
The seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree.
"That said, our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased."
Dessert: Panna Cotta was amazing.
No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.
"Anyway, I do not think i will go back there."
Sauce was tasteless.
"This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas."
Only Pros : Large seating area/ Nice bar area/ Great simple drink menu/ The BEST brick oven pizza with homemade dough!
The selection of food was not the best.
AN HOUR... seriously?
Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.
Would come back again if I had a sushi craving while in Vegas.
This place has it!
This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!
"After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods."
You can't beat that.
Great Pizza and Salads!
The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.
It was delicious!!!
"The food was very good and I enjoyed every mouthful, an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc."
I think not again
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.
I dressed up to be treated so rudely!
"The staff are great, the ambiance is great."
"The service was terrible, food was mediocre."
The cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing.
Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.
Waited and waited and waited.
I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.
"Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed."
Just spicy enough.. Perfect actually.
"If you look for authentic Thai food, go else where."
High-quality chicken on the chicken Caesar salad.
The service here leaves a lot to be desired.
The sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as I have had.
What a great double cheeseburger!
Great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting.
My boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.
We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.
Avoid at all cost!
The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood.
Ordered burger rare came in we'll done.
I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.
Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.
Best tacos in town by far!!
"For service, I give them no stars."
"I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense."
"Nice, spicy and tender."
I really enjoyed Crema Café before they expanded. I even told friends they had the BEST breakfast.
If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?
"If you want healthy authentic or ethic food, try this place."
This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.
Good prices.
I really enjoyed eating here.
"Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late."
Nargile - I think you are great.
TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.
"Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!"
"The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all."
Everything was fresh and delicious!
First - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!
It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.
This place is disgusting!
We won't be going back.
The food is good.
"It was extremely ""crumby"" and pretty tasteless."
I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.
say bye bye to your tip lady!
Would not go back.
I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.
"If you love authentic Mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting, yet delicious meats to choose from, you need to try this place."
"On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service."
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.
When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.
So don't go there if you are looking for good food...
"This was my first crawfish experience, and it was delicious!"
I've had better bagels from the grocery store.
It'll be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!
I had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas.
"Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!"
This is some seriously good pizza and I'm an expert/connisseur on the topic.
"Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while."
Each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious!
But now I was completely grossed out.
"I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one."
We definately enjoyed ourselves.
"I gave it 5 stars then, and I'm giving it 5 stars now."
"The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness."
"To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser."
"Very, very sad."
The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.
"Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it."
Damn good steak.
The food was terrible.
"Then our food came out, disappointment ensued."
"The wontons were thin, not thick and chewy, almost melt in your mouth."
I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.
Worst martini ever!
Great service and food.
I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.
Favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma!!!!!!
The jalapeno bacon is soooo good.
"Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables."
We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.
It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.
Service is also cute.
"Sadly, Gordon Ramsey's Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas."
The staff was very attentive.
Talk about great customer service of course we will be back.
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.
We loved the biscuits!!!
Nice ambiance.
"Best service and food ever, Maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day."
Great brunch spot.
Four stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe & still letting us in to eat !
Best breakfast buffet!!!
All of the tapas dishes were delicious!
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.
The grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning.
I would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza.
We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!
So absolutley fantastic.
Crostini that came with the salad was stale.
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.
"The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us."
Will not be back.
What I really like there is the crepe station.
You cant go wrong with any of the food here.
"The descriptions said ""yum yum sauce"" and another said ""eel sauce"", yet another said ""spicy mayo""...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them."
I dont think I will be back for a very long time.
I've had better atmosphere.
Not good by any stretch of the imagination.
By far the BEST cheesecurds we have ever had!
Won't ever go here again.
The waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for vegan/veggie options.
Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...
It was pretty gross!
Don't waste your time here.
The sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well.
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.
I love their fries and their beans.
"i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?"
He deserves 5 stars.
Just as good as when I had it more than a year ago!
It's too bad the food is so damn generic.
"I have eaten here multiple times, and each time the food was delicious."
The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!
"Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check."
They were excellent.
"Friend's pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it."
"Good service, very clean, and inexpensive, to boot!"
Nothing special.
A fantastic neighborhood gem !!!
Good Service-check!
"Of all the dishes, the salmon was the best, but all were great."
But I don't like it.
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.
"We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night."
We will not be coming back.
We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.
It shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs.
It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.
"Very good, though!"
Cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable.
Ambience is perfect.
The only downside is the service.
did not like at all.
"The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was."
When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.
"Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered."
Food was really good and I got full petty fast.
"Great steak, great sides, great wine, amazing desserts."
I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.
My first visit to Hiro was a delight!
"Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back."
-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.
The service here is fair at best.
And the chef was generous with his time (even came around twice so we can take pictures with him).
"Main thing I didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up."
I probably won't be coming back here.
Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!
We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.
They also have the best cheese crisp in town.
I consider this theft.
"When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way."
Waitress was a little slow in service.
"Phenomenal food, service and ambiance."
Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.
We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.
"That just SCREAMS ""LEGIT"" in my book...somethat's also pretty rare here in Vegas."
Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.
you can watch them preparing the delicious food!)
Check it out.
My friend did not like his Bloody Mary.
It was awesome.
"The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor."
Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.
The service was poor and thats being nice.
2 Thumbs Up!!
Special thanks to Dylan T. for the recommendation on what to order :) All yummy for my tummy.
Total brunch fail.
"I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food."
"At first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe - nice ambiance, clean, friendly staff."
"All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop."
The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.
This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.
I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.
I probably would not go here again.
"This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed."
Highly recommended.
"Give it a try, you will be happy you did."
If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!
The ambiance isn't much better.
It was equally awful.
The food is very good for your typical bar food.
"The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits."
We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either.
"This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant."
"After one bite, I was hooked."
Go To Place for Gyros.
I loved the bacon wrapped dates.
- They never brought a salad we asked for.
"The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger."
I like Steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar.
The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.
Server did a great job handling our large rowdy table.
This is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!!
"Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table."
It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.
And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.
This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.
Hell no will I go back
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.
The cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me.
The food came out at a good pace.
I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.
"The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either."
Always a pleasure dealing with him.
The ambiance was incredible.
"I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back ""ya'all""."
Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.
"As for the service: I'm a fan, because it's quick and you're being served by some nice folks."
We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.
"Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced."
We won't be returning.
We waited for forty five minutes in vain.
And service was super friendly.
the presentation of the food was awful.
"When I'm on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot I'll hit up again!"
"At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn't that busy."
This is an unbelievable BARGAIN!
The steak was amazing...rge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had!
"I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious."
"On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop."
"Our server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end."
"I got to enjoy the seafood salad, with a fabulous vinegrette."
"All in all, I can assure you I'll be back."
I had a pretty satifying experience.
As a sushi lover avoid this place by all means.
"Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing."
"They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food."
This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.
"Great place to eat, reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the San Francisco Bay Area."
"The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat."
The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.
It was just not a fun experience.
I won't be back.
"The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather."
The fries were great too.
Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.
Ample portions and good prices.
I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.
Great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer.
"Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too."
Food was really boring.
An extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast.
We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.
"a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait."
Nicest Chinese restaurant I've been in a while.
Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.
The restaurant atmosphere was exquisite.
!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!
I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it.
I can take a little bad service but the food sucks.
My fiancé and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.
"The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff."
The Macarons here are insanely good.
"No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts."
"I really do recommend this place, you can go wrong with this donut place!"
The service was extremely slow.
"It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign."
"The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace."
"The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow."
"Cute, quaint, simple, honest."
"If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you."
Never had anything to complain about here.
The atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested.
5 stars for the brick oven bread app!
The manager was the worst.
The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL!
"The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined."
"The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten."
The price is reasonable and the service is great.
We made the drive all the way from North Scottsdale... and I was not one bit disappointed!
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.
My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.
I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.
I will not be eating there again.
I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.
"I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location."
This one is simply a disappointment.
Service was fine and the waitress was friendly.
It was probably dirt.
The warm beer didn't help.
Wow very spicy but delicious.
"Seriously flavorful delights, folks."
Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).
WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.
Tasted like dirt.
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.
I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.
"After 20 minutes wait, I got a table."
"Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas."
"I was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable."
I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!
"The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily."
My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.
"Probably never coming back, and wouldn't recommend it."
"How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!"
- the food is rich so order accordingly.
I'm not eating here!
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed.
"Level 5 spicy was perfect, where spice didn't over-whelm the soup."
I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.
"What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us."
Pretty awesome place.
Weird vibe from owners.
"Food was good, service was good, Prices were good."
I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas.
"Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees."
Thoroughly disappointed!
"Thus far, have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time."
This place should honestly be blown up.
I'd love to go back.
The pancake was also really good and pretty large at that.
This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.
"I probably won't be back, to be honest."
Very very fun chef.
The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.
I just wanted to leave.
I promise they won't disappoint.
"They will customize your order any way you'd like, my usual is Eggplant with Green Bean stir fry, love it!"
We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.
"I ate there twice on my last visit, and especially enjoyed the salmon salad."
"Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks."
The nachos are a MUST HAVE!
I can't wait to go back.
"Back to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways."
Great food.
I don't know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea.
Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!
"I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible!?!"
Best fish I've ever had in my life!
They know how to make them here.
Will not be back!
Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.
"Same evening, him and I are both drastically sick."
I waited and waited.
I took back my money and got outta there.
WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.
"It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad."
Con: spotty service.
I love this place.
Great pork sandwich.
"Classy/warm atmosphere, fun and fresh appetizers, succulent steaks (Baseball steak!!!!!"
I would not recommend this place.
This is a good joint.
"It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry."
We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!
"Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house."
I will not return.
My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.
This place was such a nice surprise!
Very bad Experience!
I would not recommend this place.
AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!
The real disappointment was our waiter.
Service was good and the company was better!
So good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night.
I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.
By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.
"Needless to say, we will never be back here again."
"Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE."
Those burgers were amazing.
The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.
I had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas!
"We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad, the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste."
The patio seating was very comfortable.
My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.
Some may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!
"In fact I'm going to round up to 4 stars, just because she was so awesome."
The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.
"Overall, I like there food and the service."
We'll never go again.
I believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi.
Horrible - don't waste your time and money.
I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.
Our server was super nice and checked on us many times.
It was absolutely amazing.
Definitely not worth the $3 I paid.
I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.
Seriously killer hot chai latte.
I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place.
"I have been here several times in the past, and the experience has always been great."
"My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too."
Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos!
One of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again .
"To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted."
The Jamaican mojitos are delicious.
The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.
"It's close to my house, it's low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food."
"Our waiter was very attentive, friendly, and informative."
Disappointing experience.
"The chicken I got was definitely reheated and was only ok, the wedges were cold and soggy."
I love the decor with the Chinese calligraphy wall paper.
Last night was my second time dining here and I was so happy I decided to go back!
Great food and awesome service!
"Very good food, great atmosphere.1"
It was not good.
They were golden-crispy and delicious.
A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!
"He also came back to check on us regularly, excellent service."
I'll definitely be in soon again.
Cant say enough good things about this place.
"The burger is good beef, cooked just right."
I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.
"Unfortunately, it was not good."
I recently tried Caballero's and I have been back every week since!
"I had heard good things about this place, but it exceeding every hope I could have dreamed of."
"Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even."
"This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff."
I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.
This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.
How awesome is that.
"the food is not tasty at all, not to say its ""real traditional Hunan style""."
RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.
This place is amazing!
First time going but I think I will quickly become a regular.
Awesome service and food.
I will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night ... highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area.
OMG I felt like I had never eaten Thai food until this dish.
Their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite.
"He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas."
The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.
The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.
Food was average at best.
I wouldn't return.
"too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place."
"Oh this is such a thing of beauty, this restaurant."
Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.
She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.
We are so glad we found this place.
"This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!"
I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.
The shrimp tender and moist.
"Worse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name callings."
"The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes."
Interesting decor.
But the service was beyond bad.
Soggy and not good.
Once your food arrives it's meh.
Their chow mein is so good!
"I love the owner/chef, his one authentic Japanese cool dude!"
"The burger... I got the ""Gold Standard"" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed."
"I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!"
We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.
Awesome selection of beer.
"You get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care."
I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak.
There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.
"One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that."
The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.
The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.
Appetite instantly gone.
I can say that the desserts were yummy.
"Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil."
"For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed."
Food was great and so was the serivce!
I was seated immediately.
"I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!"
"As for the service, I thought it was good."
"Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon."
Have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome!!
We enjoy their pizza and brunch.
Do not waste your money here!
Great time - family dinner on a Sunday night.
So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!
I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!
Def coming back to bowl next time
Crust is not good.
Don't bother coming here.
Food was below average.
After two I felt disgusting.
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.
Very good lunch spot.
"Overall, I like this place a lot."
Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.
Terrible service!
Waiter was a jerk.
The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.
My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm.
"It's like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party."
There is nothing authentic about this place.
"I had strawberry tea, which was good."
Generous portions and great taste.
Pretty good beer selection too.
These were so good we ordered them twice.
Now this dish was quite flavourful.
"I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken, with cranberry...mmmm!"
The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.
I miss it and wish they had one in Philadelphia!
This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.
"Stopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman, very friendly, kind staff."
This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.
"for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food."
A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.
What a mistake.
It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done.
Delicious and I will absolutely be back!
"I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list."
The waitress and manager are so friendly.
Very poor service.
"(It wasn't busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold."
"The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an ""Are you being helped?"""
There was hardly any meat.
A good time!
"Prices are very reasonable, flavors are spot on, the sauce is home made, and the slaw is not drenched in mayo."
"Also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good."
"Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder."
"Anyways, The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more."
"Third, the cheese on my friend's burger was cold."
Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.
"I don't each much pasta, but I love the homemade /hand made pastas and thin pizzas here."
"The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked."
"Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee."
My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.
"Went in for happy hour, great list of wines."
"I always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner, which has a wide array of options to choose from."
The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful.
"The food, amazing."
Never going back.
We loved the place.
I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.
I liked the patio and the service was outstanding.
But then they came back cold.
Both of the egg rolls were fantastic.
I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.
"I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat."
I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.
The menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide!
It's worth driving up from Tucson!
* Both the Hot & Sour & the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely 5 Stars!
"In the summer, you can dine in a charming outdoor patio - so very delightful."
"Very convenient, since we were staying at the MGM!"
This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.
Both great!
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.
"On the up side, their cafe serves really good food."
"The dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable."
All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!
Best tater tots in the southwest.
The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.
Extremely Tasty!
I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food.
"Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries."
An absolute must visit!
The Burrittos Blah!
"The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible."
"- Really, really good rice, all the time."
"The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal!"
The Veggitarian platter is out of this world!
"This place is pretty good, nice little vibe in the restaurant."
It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.
"Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it."
